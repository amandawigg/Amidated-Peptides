This code predicts putative amidated peptides within 3-15 amino acids in length. The algorithm inputs secretome sequences predicts cleavages sites based on dibasic PCSK site or signal peptide on the N-temrinus, and glycine-dibasic on the C-terminus for the amidation motif. The secretome files are in the repository and were selected based on keywords "secreted" or "extracellular" and not "transmembrane" in Uniprot. The output is a csv file with peptide sequences.
